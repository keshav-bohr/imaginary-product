    "React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently. With its virtual DOM implementation, React optimizes rendering performance and provides a smooth user experience.",
    "Performance optimization is crucial for modern web applications. Techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, memoization, and virtualization can significantly improve application responsiveness and reduce resource consumption. Understanding these patterns is essential for building scalable applications.",
    "React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:",
    "State management becomes challenging as applications grow. Solutions like Redux, Context API, and Zustand offer different approaches to managing global state. Choosing the right tool depends on application complexity and team preferences.",
    "React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, you’ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.",
